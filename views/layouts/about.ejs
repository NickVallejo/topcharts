          <h1>Welcome to Top Charts</h1>
          <p>
            I've been working on-and-off on this project for almost a year now. It started as a fun challenge for
            myself,
            but quickly grew into an idea that I wanted to take live. There have been many charting sites in the past
            that
            are still really popular on Reddit and 4chan, and while those sites are fantastic, I felt like there was a
            lot
            more that could be done with the concept as a whole. With this platform, users can save charts, share
            charts,
            listen to albums on their charts, and get new recommendations for music based off those charts they've
            created. There's still a lot more that I want to do with this platform.<span class="green-span">
              Some of the features I want to implement in the future are as follows:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ability to follow other users and see when they create new charts</li>
            <li>The ability to save albums to a “listen later” list</li>
            <li>
              Establish a proper dashboard that gives recommendations to charts you might be interested in, depending on
              the music you like, as well as a feed possibly? (This idea isn't entirely fleshed out)
            </li>
            <li>Offer more customization options for chart image downloads if the feature is requested</li>
            <li>
              Flesh out user profiles more to allow a “favourite albums” section, bio, and other info about the user
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, expand to other mediums in the future including video games, movies, books and other kinds of
              charts
            </li>
          </ul>
